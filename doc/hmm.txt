COMMANDS                                        *hmm-commands*

These commands integrate the `hmm` command-line utility with Vim.

                                                *:Hmm* *hmm-:Hmm*
:Hmm[!] [args]             Invoke `hmm [args]` and load the output into a
                           buffer. If the current buffer is not associated
                           with a file and empty, or if ! is given, overwrite
                           the current buffer contents. Otherwise open a new
                           one.
